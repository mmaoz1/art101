			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to practice psuedo code and problem solving. We are tasked with breaking down
						complicated tasks into small, incremental steps. Both for a real life task and a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The challenge for me in this lab was to break down 'rock, paper sciscors' as a comptuer game and make it into small steps. 
						I'm not too familiar with this type of coding so I took a shot in the dark on what would actually need to be done in order to write this code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was helpful for learning how to create an outline for coding and problem solving. I was much more familiar with my first set of Instructions
						on how to record music. Thus my list was much more extensive. On the other hand, my instructions for creating an online rock, paper, scissors game
					were shorter, since I really don't even know where to start. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
					Instructions for recording a song:
						// Open a DAW (Digital Audio Workspace) on your computer
						// Navigate to “create a new audio track”
						// Select yes
						// Connect an audio interface via USB-C
						// Navigate to settings and select the name of the interface for input and output
						// Navigate back to the main workstation of the DAW
						// Select “input 1” on track head
						// Toggle Record on track head
						// Connect an electric guitar via quarter-inch cable to input 1 of audio interface
						// Turn the gain knob up on the interface
						// Look at track 1 in your DAW and ensure that you are receiving about 12db of signal gain
						// Press record on the top of your DAW
						// Strum your instrument
						// Press “space” to stop recording
						// Press “space to listen back to your recording
					Instructions for online "rock paper scissors" game:
						// Print options on screen before each turn (rock, paper, and scissors)
						// Accept user input
						// Validate user input
						// Choose computer move
						// Display user and computer moves on screen
						// Test of win or draw condition

					</pre></code>
